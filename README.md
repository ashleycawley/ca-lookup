# ca-lookup
A homemade dig/whois lookup tool, pulls relevant concise information from both tools.

## Usage
ca-lookup.sh example.com

*or*

check example.com

## Installation

### Linux
1) Download the script with wget or curl:

```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashleycawley/ca-lookup/master/ca-lookup.sh```

2) Move the script into position, this is where you get to **choose which command name you would like** to use when running this tool, in the example below I will use the script name *check* which you can see on the end of the command, but you could choose *dnsreport* or anything else you prefer.

```sudo cp ca-lookup.sh /usr/bin/check```

3) Give it a whirl! It may work for you immediately or you may need to reload your Terminal session first.
